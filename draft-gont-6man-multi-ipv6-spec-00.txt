Abstract

   This document specifies a improvements to IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoncofiguration (SLAAC) to fully support common multi-router and
   multi-prefix scenarios.  It formally updates RFC 4191, RFC 4861, RFC
   4862, and RFC 8504, and obsoletes RFC 8028, such that these scenarios
   are properly supported by IPv6 host implementations.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is based on the
   premise that SLAAC routers advertise configuration information on a
   local network and SLAAC hosts aggregate this information and use it
   as they see fits.  In the case of simple network such as a local
   network with a single SLAAC router, or a network with multiple SLAAC
   routers where all routers advertise the same network configuration
   information, SLAAC works just fine.  However, slightly more complex
   (yet very common) scenarios are very badly supported (if at all).
   THese scenarios include, but are not limited to, the following:

   *  Two Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) routers are attached to a
      local network, whether to perform basic load-sharing across the
      two upstream connctions, or for improved resiliency (i.e. provide
      a fall-back upstream Internet connection).

   *  An IPv6 host attaches to two different local networks via
      different network interfaces.  For example, an IPv6 host employ a
      wired Ethernet connection and a Wi-Fi wireless connection.

Internet-Draft  Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefi   February 2025


   *  A mobile node employs a 4G mobile connection, and also leverages
      WiFi connectivity where available.

   As discussed in [I-D.gont-v6ops-multi-ipv6], these scenarios are not
   only common, but support for these scenarios may actually represent a
   pre-requisite for deploying IPv6 in an Enterprise or home office
   enfironments.  Therefore, they warrant native and proper support by
   IPv6 hosts.

   [RFC8028] discussed the challenge of selecting an appropriate default
   router in Multi-IPv6 scenarios, and specified recommendations in that
   space.  This document builds upon [RFC8028] to provide a more
   comprehensive solution to the problem at hand.

2.  Terminology

   Multi-IPv6:
      The term "Multi-IPv6" (case insensitive) is employed throughout
      this document as a short-hand for network scenarios where multiple
      IPv6 routers and/or multiple IPv6 prefixe are employed.

   SLAAC prefix set:
      The SLAAC prefix set for an SLAAC router is composed of all
      prefixes that have been advertised by the router via SLAAC PIOs
      (irrespective of how e.g. the "A" and "L" flags of the PIO were
      set).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Conceptual model

   The key to properly support multi-ipv6 scenarios is for IPv6 hosts to
   employ SLAAC network configuration according to these principles:

   *  SLAAC configuration information advertised by a SLAAC router
      should be considered an atomic set of information that is not
      aggregatable with information advertised by any other local SLAAC
      routers.  This means that:

Internet-Draft  Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefi   February 2025


      -  Hosts should maintain state for SLAAC information on a per-
         router basis (as opposed to "per-host" or "per-interface"
         basis.  If the same piece of information is advertised by
         multiple SLAAC routers, host must maintain state information
         for the advertised information on a per-router basis *i.e.,
         onces for each advertising router).

      -  As a result of this consideration, in scenarios where the same
         network configuration information is originally advertised by
         multiple local SLAAC routers, such information may eventually
         expire or be considered invalid for one of the SLAAC routers
         that advertised it, but still be valid for some of the other
         routers that have advertised it (since state is maintained on a
         per-router basis as opposed to a per-host basis).

      -  Hosts should not employ information advertised by one SLAAC
         router along with information advertised by a different SLAAC
         router.  For example, in a network scenario where SLAAC router
         ROUTER_A advertises {RDNSS_A, autoconfiguration prefix
         PREFIX_A} and SLAAC router ROUTER_B advertises {RDNSS_B,
         autoconfiguration prefix PREFIX_B}, SLAACs hosts should NOT do
         any of the following:

         o  Send packets from PREFIX_A via ROUTER_B (or packets from
            PREFIX_B via ROUTER_A)

         o  Send DNS queries from PREFIX_A to RDNSS_B (or queries from
            PREFIX_B to RDNSS_A)

         o  Send packets from PREFIX_A to an IPv6 address obtained via
            RDNSS_B (or packets from PREFIX_B to an IPv6 address
            obtained via RDNSS_A)

   *  A addresses configured from a given SLAAC prefix should only be
      employed with the SLAAC routers that have advertised such prefix
      on the local network.  Please note that is quite common for IPv6
      routers to enforce ingress/egress filtering, and thus in a
      scenario where SLAAC router ROUTER_A advertises {RDNSS_A,
      autoconfiguration prefix PREFIX_A} and SLAAC router ROUTER_B
      advertises {RDNSS_B, autoconfiguration prefix PREFIX_B}, ROUTER_A
      might drop outgoing packets that are not sourced from PREFIX_A,
      while ROUTER_B might drop outgoing packets that are not sourced
      from PREFIX_B.

   *  It is not uncommon for hosts to enforce Access Control Lists
      (ACLs) based on the IPv6 address of incoming requests.  Thus, as
      noted above, this means that:

      -  In a scenario where SLAAC router ROUTER_A advertises {RDNSS_A,
         autoconfiguration prefix PREFIX_A} and SLAAC router ROUTER_B
         advertises {RDNSS_B, autoconfiguration prefix PREFIX_B},
         RDNSS_A might drop DNS queries that do not originate from
         PREFIX_A, while RDNSS_B might drop DNS queries that do not
         originate from PREFIX_B.

      -  Communications with addresses obtained via a RDNSS should be
         carried out using source addresses from the prefix-set fo the
         router that advertised the RDNSS that was employed for name
         resultionn.  In a scenario where SLAAC router ROUTER_A
         advertises {RDNSS_A, autoconfiguration prefix PREFIX_A} and
         SLAAC router ROUTER_B advertises {RDNSS_B, autoconfiguration
         prefix PREFIX_B}, RNDSS_A might resolve e.g. "www.example.com"
         to an IPv6 address that will drop incoming requests unless they
         originate from PREFIX_A, while RDNSS_B might resolve the same
         domain name ("www.example.com") to a different IPv6 address
         that will drop incoming requests unless they originate from
         PREFIX_B.

4.  Protocol Specification

   *  SLAAC hosts MUST maintain state information for each piece of
      SLAAC information advertised by each SLAAC router, on a per-router
      basis.  This means, for example, that for each piece of SLAAC
      information that employs "lifetimes", the associated current
      lifetimes should be computed/maintained on a per-router basis.  If
      a per-router lifetime e.g. expires, this should only affect the
      usage of such information via the router for which the "lifetime"
      has expired (please see Appendix A.2 for a more detailed
      discussion).

   *  SLAAC hosts MUST associate each SLAAC router with an IPv6 prefix
      set, that is composed of all prefixes that has been advertised by
      the router via SLAAC PIOs (irrespective of how e.g. the "A" and
      "L" flags of the PIO were set).

   *  When sending packets via a SLAAC router, SLAAC hosts MUST set the
      IPv6 Source Address of such packets to an belonging to the prefix
      set of such router.

   *  Any routing information (such as that conveyed via RIOs [RFC4191]
      and Redirect messages [RFC4861]) MUST NOT be employed for packets
      sent with a Source Address that does not belong to the IPv6 prefix
      set of the SLAAC router that advertised this information .

Internet-Draft  Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefi   February 2025


   *  DNS queries sent to a RDNSS SHOULD employ source addresses from
      the prefix set of the router that advertised the RDNSS.  For
      example, if only SLAAC router ROUTER_A has advertised RDNSS_A, DNS
      queries sent tO RDNSS_A should employ addresses from PREFIX_A.

   *  Information obtained from a RDNSS server MUST only be employed
      using IPv6 source address from the same prefix employed for the
      source address of the DNS queries to the RDNSS.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new attack vectors to the ones
   associated with IPv8 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] and IPv6 Stateless
   Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).

   If attacks based on forged RA packets are a concern, technologies
   such as RA-Guard [RFC6105] [RFC7113] should be deployed.

Appendix A.  Sample scenarios

A.1.  Normal Usage of SLAAC Information by IPv6 Hosts

   Consider the following scenario:

   *  Two SLAAC routers (ROUTER_A and ROUTER_B) from different ISPs
      (ISP_A and ISP_B, respectively) are attached to NETWORK_C

   *  Router A advertises:

      -  Prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by means of a Prefix
         Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]).




Gont                      Expires 7 August 2025                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft  Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefi   February 2025


      -  One Recursive DNS server (RDNNSS_A) (by means of Recursive DNS
         Server option [RFC8106]).

   *  Router B advertises:

      -  Prefix PREFIX_B for address configuration (by means of a Prefix
         Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]).

      -  One Recursive DNS server (RDNSS_B) (by means of Recursive DNS
         Server option [RFC8106]).

   An IPv6 host that attaches to Network C and receives the
   aforementioned information should interpret it as follows:

   *  It may configure IPv6 addresses from PREFIX_A, and send packets
      from such addresses via ROUTER_A.  It may send DNS queries to
      RDNSS_A from addresses in PREFIX_A, via ROUTER_A, and initiate
      communication with the resulting IPv6 addresses using source
      addresses from PREFIX_A (via ROUTER_A, as noted above).

   *  It may configure IPv6 addresses from PREFIX_B, and send packets
      from such addresses via ROUTER_B.  It may send DNS queries to
      RDNSS_B from addresses in PREFIX_B, via ROUTER_B, and initiate
      communication with resulting IPv6 addresses using source addresses
      from PREFIX_B (via ROUTER_B, as noted above).

   Any other combination of the network configuration information that
   mixes information from ROUTER_A and ROUTER_B is likely to result in
   interoperability problems and/or suboptimal service, since e.g.:

   *  ROUTER_A may implement network ingress filtering, and thus drop
      packets originating from NETWORK_C if they do not employ a source
      address from PREFIX_A.

   *  RDNSS_A may implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) such that it
      only accepts DNS queries from addresses in PREFIX_A.

   *  DNS Resolution of a domain name (e.g. "www.example.com may") may
      employ "split-horizon" DNS, and the domain name may map to
      different IPv6 addreses depending on the RDNSS employed for name
      resolution and/or the IPv6 addresses employed for the source
      address of the DNS queries.  When "www.example.com" is resolved by
      means of RDNSS_A, the resulting IPv6 addresses are likely to be
      topologically close to ISP_A.  Thus, a host that resolves
      "www.example.com" via RDNSS_A but then initiates communication
      with the resulting IPv6 addresses via ISP_B is likely to receive
      sub-optimal service (e.g. longer Round-Trip Times (RTTs)).  The
      corresponding systems might as well be prepared to only service
      ISP_A, and enforce ACLs dropping traffic that does not originate
      from PREFIX_A.

A.2.  Information Advertised by Multiple Routers on the Same Link

   Similarly, consider this other network scenario:

   *  Two SLAAC routers (ROUTER_A1 and ROUTER_A2), both from ISP_A, are
      attached to NETWORK_C

   *  Router A1 advertises:

      -  Prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by means of a Prefix
         Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]).

      -  One Recursive DNS server (RDNSS_A) (by means of Recursive DNS
         Server option [RFC8106]).

   *  Router A2 advertises:

      -  Prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by means of a Prefix
         Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]).

      -  One Recursive DNS server (RDNSS_A) (by means of Recursive DNS
         Server option [RFC8106]).

   Let us assume that, at some point in time, ROUTER_A2 starts
   invalidating the previously-advertised information.  Namely,

   *  Router A2 starts to advertise prefix PREFIX_A for address
      configuration (by means of a Prefix Information Option (PIO)
      [RFC4861]) with a "valid lifetime" of 0.

   *  Router A2 starts to advertise RDNSS_A (by means of Recursive DNS
      Server option [RFC8106]) with a "lifetime" of 0.

Internet-Draft  Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefi   February 2025


   A SLAAC host that receives this (updated) information should
   interpret it as:

   *  As far as ROUTER_A2 is concerned, addresses in PREFIX_A are no
      longer valid, and should not be used when sending IPv6 packets via
      ROUTER_A2.

   *  As far as ROUTER_A2 is concerned, RDNSS_A is no longer a valid
      RDNSS.

   *  However, this should not affect the validity of this information
      (ot its usage) with other SLAAC routers.  Namely, in our scenario,
      a SLAAC host attached to NETWORK_C should still consider addresses
      in PREFIX_A to be valid when e.g. used in conjunction with
      ROUTER_A1, and should still consider RDNSS_A to be a valid RDNSS
      to send queries from PREFIX_A via ROUTER_A1.

   *  Only when a piece of SLAAC information is no longer valid for any
      of SLAAC router would the corresponding information be completely
      removed from the SLAAC host.

Appendix B.  Possible Implementation Approaches

   WHile this document specifies normative requirements regarding the
   expected behavior of SLAAC hosts, it does not specify requirements
   regarding how the required behavior should be achieved -- that is, it
   does not require usage of any specific mechanisms to achive the
   required behavior.

   This section provides non-normative discussion of possible
   implementation approaches to comply with the requirements in this
   document.
