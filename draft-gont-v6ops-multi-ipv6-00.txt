Abstract

   This document discusses current limitations in IPv6 Stateless Address
   Auto-cofiguration (SLAAC) that prevent support for common multi-
   router and multi-interface scenarios.  It provides discussion on the
   challenges that these scenarios represent, and why a solution in this
   space is warranted.  Finally, it specifies a number of common
   scenarios that any solution in this space should be able to address.

1.  Introduction

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) [RFC4862] is based
   on the assumption that SLAAC routers advertise configuration
   information on a local network, and SLAAC hosts will aggregate this
   information and use it they see fits.  Simple network scenarios where
   there is a single local router, or where there are multiple routers
   but all such routers advertise the same information and provide the
   same service, SLAAC works just fine.  However, other more complex
   (yet very common) scenarios are currently unsupported (or may only be
   supported by means of non-standard behaviors).  These scenarios
   include:

   *  A host that attaches to a local-area network (LAN) that employs
      two different routers, one for each upstream Internet Service
      Provider (ISP).

   *  A multihomed host connects to two (or more) different networks via
      two (or more) network interfaces.

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement about Multi-Router and   November 2024


   *  A host attaches to a local-area network, and receives conflicting
      information from two or more SLAAC routers.

   In the first two scenarios, a SLAAC host will end up receiving
   information from two routers that are managed by different entities
   (ISPs) and, for all practical purposes, each piece of configuration
   information advertised by each router is only of use when employed in
   conjunction with the rest of the information advertised by such
   router, and via the router that advertised it.  In other words,
   mixing configuration information from the advertising routers will
   usually lead to interoperability problems.

   The third scenario could be considered a corner-case of the first two
   scenarios: two or more routers send conflicting information, such as
   the same SLAAC configuration information with different lifetimes
   (e.g., one SLAAC router advertises the information with a lifetime of
   zero, and another advertises the same information with non-zero
   lifetime).  In this scenario, a single router advertising
   configuration information with a lifetime of zero may simply cause
   hosts to remove that information altogether.

   Section 2 defines the terminology employed throughout this document.
   Section 3 elaborate on the scenarios described earlier in this
   section, which not only serve to define the problem statement, but
   also as test cases for any solution to it.  Section 5 discusses
   future work may be needed to address the problem at hand.

2.  Terminology

   Multi-router scenario:
      A network scenario where two or more routers are attached to the
      same link.

   Multi-interface scenario:
      A network scenario where a host employs two or more network
      interfaces (without considering the "loopback" interface).  Some
      bibliography refer to these hosts as being "multihomed".

3.  Scenarios

3.1.  Multi-Router Scenario

   Consider a network scenario where a user attaches two Customer
   Premises Equipment (CPE) routers to a local network ("Network_C" in
   our example) for improved network resilience, The scenario could be
   defined/described as follows:

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement about Multi-Router and   November 2024


   *  Two SLAAC routers (Router_A and Router_B) from different ISPs
      (ISP_A and ISP_B, respectively) are attached to Network C

   *  Router A advertises prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by
      means of a Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]), and also
      enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  Router A also advertises one Recursive DNS server (RDNNSS_A) (by
      means of Recursive DNS Server option [RFC8106]), and implements
      ACLs such that it only processes requests from ISP_A customers.

   *  Router B advertises prefix PREFIX_B for address configuration (by
      means of a Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]), and also
      enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  Router B also advertises one Recursive DNS server (RDNSS_B) (by
      means of Recursive DNS Server option [RFC8106]), and implements
      ACLs such that it only processes requests from ISP_B customers.

   *  Host C attaches to Network C, and thus configures:

      -  Addresses in both prefixes (PREFIX_A and PREFIX_B).

      -  Two default routers (Router_A and Router_B).

      -  Two recursive DNS servers: RDNSS_A and RDNSS_B.

   In this scenario, Host C may only send traffic from PREFIX_A via
   ROUTER_A or from PREFIX_B via ROUTER_B: otherwise, packets will be
   dropped as a result of ingress filtering [RFC2827].  Similarly, Host
   C may only send DNS queries from PREFIX_A to RDNSS_A, or from
   PREFIX_B to RDNSS_B: sending traffic from PREFIX_A to RDNSS_B or from
   PREFIX_B to RDNSS_A will result in the ACLs enforced by the
   respective ISPs to drop the DNS queries.

   Additionally, it should be noted that it is quite common for DNS
   responses to depend on the source address of the query.  For example,
   if ISP_A had a cache for the site www.example.com, it is quite likely
   that a query for www.example.com will map to addresses that are
   topologically close to ISP_A (or even within ISP_A), for improved
   service.  However, if Host C where to send DNS queries to RDNSS_A,
   but then issue connections from PREFIX_B, it would most likely enjoy
   suboptimal service (if not blocked).

   It should be evident that each piece of information being advertised
   via SLAAC is only usable when employed in conjunction with the rest
   of the information advertised by the same router.  However, SLAAC
   does not require this behavior: according to the current
   specifications, hosts are free to use any piece of configuration they
   learn via SLAAC as they see fit.

3.2.  Multi-Interface Scenario

   This scenario is similar to the one described in Section 3.1 with the
   only difference in that a host communicated with the two routers over
   different network interfaces.

   Consider a network scenario where a user connects to two different
   ISPs (ISP_A and ISP_B), via two different network interfaced (e.g.,
   one Ethernet interface and a wireless Wi-Fi interface).  The scenario
   could be defined/described as follows:

   *  A SLAAC router (Router_A) from ISP_A is attached to Network_A.

   *  A SLAAC router (Router_B) from ISP_B is attached to Network_B.

   *  Router A advertises prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by
      means of a Prefix Information Options (PIO) [RFC4861]), and also
      enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  Router A also advertises one Recursive DNS server (RDNNSS_A) (by
      means of Recursive DNS Server option [RFC8106]), and implements
      ACLs such that it only processes requests from ISP_A customers.

   *  Router B advertises prefix PREFIX_B for address configuration (by
      means of a Prefix Information Options (PIO) [RFC4861]), and also
      enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  Router B also advertises one Recursive DNS server (RDNSS_B) (by
      means of Recursive DNS Server option [RFC8106]), and implements
      ACLs such that it only processes requests from ISP_B customers.

   *  Host C attaches to Network_A with one network interface, and to
      Network_B with another network interface, and configures:

      -  Addresses in both prefixes (PREFIX_A and PREFIX_B).

      -  Two default routers (Router_A and Router_B).

      -  Two recursive DNS servers: RDNSS_A and RDNSS_B.

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement about Multi-Router and   November 2024


   In this scenario, Host C may only send traffic from PREFIX_A via
   ROUTER_A or from PREFIX_B via ROUTER_B: otherwise, packets will be
   dropped as a result of ingress filtering [RFC2827].  Similarly, Host
   C may only send DNS queries from PREFIX_A to RDNSS_A, or from
   PREFIX_B to RDNSS_B: sending traffic from PREFIX_A to RDNSS_B or from
   PREFIX_B to RDNSS_A will resul in the ACLs enforced by the respective
   ISPs to drop the DNS queries.

   Additionally, it should be noted that it is quite common for DNS
   responses to depend on the source address of the query.  For example,
   if ISP_A had a cache for the site www.example.com, it is quite likely
   that a query for www.example.com will map to addresses that are
   topologically close to ISP_A (or even within ISP_A), for improved
   service.  However, if Host C where to send DNS queries to RDNSS_A,
   but then issue conenctions from PREFIX_B, it would most likely enjoy
   suboptimal service (if not blocked).

   It should be evident that each piece of information being advertised
   via SLAAC is only usable when employed in conjuction with the rest of
   the information advertised by the same router.  However, SLAAC does
   not require this behavior: acording to the current specifications,
   hosts are free to use any piece of configuration they learn via SLAAC
   as they see fit.

   NOTE:
      A host implementing the Weak End System (ES) model (see
      Section 3.3.4.2 from [RFC1122]) could indeed send e.g. packets
      from PREFIX_A to ROUTER_B.

3.3.  Conflicting Information

   Consider the case where two routers attach to the same network, and
   advertise the same configuration information.  That is,

   *  Two SLAAC routers (Router_A and Router_B) are attached to
      Network_C

   *  Router A advertises prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by
      means of a Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]).

   *  Router A also advertises one Recursive DNS server (RDNNSS_A) (by
      means of Recursive DNS Server option [RFC8106]).

   *  Router B advertises prefix PREFIX_A for address configuration (by
      means of a Prefix Information Option (PIO) [RFC4861]).

   *  Router B also advertises one Recursive DNS server (RDNSS_A) (by
      means of Recursive DNS Server option [RFC8106]).

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement about Multi-Router and   November 2024


   *  Host C attaches to Network_C, and thus configures:

      -  Addresses in PREFIX_A.

      -  Two default routers (Router_A and Router_B).

      -  One recursive DNS servers: RDNSS_A.

   Consider the case where e.g.  Router_B is unable to refresh its
   network configuration information from its upstream, and thus
   advertises the same configuration as before, but with a lifetime of
   0.  That is, it advertises:

   *  A PIO conveying PREFIX_A with both a Preferred Lifetime and a
      Valid Lifetime of 0.

   *  A RDNSS conveying RDNSS_A with a Lifetime of 0.

   Presumably, this means that according to Router_B, this information
   should no longer be used:

   *  Hosts should remove any configured addresses for such prefixes.
      As a result, they would also abort any ongoing TCP connections.

   *  Hosts should also remove the corresponding RDNSS server from their
      list of RDNSS servers.

   This would also happen if Router_A was still announcing the same
   configuration information with non-zero lifetimes.

   It is clear that a more resilient behavior would be to maintain
   different timers for each SLAAC advertising router.  Thus, if a SLAAC
   router advertised some configuration information with a lifetime of
   0, this would simply mean that such configuration information would
   be disassociated with that particular router.  Only when
   configuration information is no longer associated with any router
   would the information be removed from the host altogether.

4.  Prior Work

   [RFC8028] has analyzed the challenge represented by having multiple
   default routers when addresses from multiple prefixes are employed.
   However, there are at least two gaps in the specification:

   *  Extrapolating RFC 8028 to other network configuration information
      (such as Route Information Options (RIOs) [RFC4191] and RDNSS
      [RFC8106]).

Internet-Draft  Problem Statement about Multi-Router and   November 2024


   *  Considering some corner cases that must be properly handled when
      implementing the recommendations from [RFC8028], such as how to
      aggregate configuration information when the same information is
      advertised by multiple routers, with different timers/lifetime
      values (as discussed in Section 3.3).

5.  Future Work

   This document describes a number of common network scenarios that are
   currently unsupported by IPv6.  These scenarios have become more and
   more common, as a result of:

   *  Increased number of home-office users, requiring the use of
      multiple upstream ISP for improved resiliency

   *  Increased number of mobile users, which may not only connect via
      the mobile operator but also via a Wi-Fi connection when
      available.

   As a result, this document concludes that protocol improvements that
   accommodate these deployment scenarios are warranted.

   [draft-gont-6man-rfc8028-update-00] is an ongoing effort to improve
   IPv6 Support for Multiple Routers and Multiple Interfaces.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new attack vectors.
