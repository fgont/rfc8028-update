        Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefix IPv6 Networks
                   draft-gont-6man-rfc8028-update-00

Abstract

   This document discusses current limitations in IPv6 Stateless Address
   Autoncofiguration (SLAAC) that prevents support for general and
   common multi-router and multi-prefix scenarios.  It formally updates
   RFC 4861, RFC 4862, and RFC 8028 such that such scenarios are
   properly supported.  This document also formally updates RFC 8504,
   thus requiring support of multi-router and multi-prefix networks to
   all IPv6 nodes.

1.  Informal Introduction (to be removed)

   Whenever multiple routers of multiple prefixes are available on a
   local network, we end up looking at RFC 8028.  The more recent
   instances of this have been [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6724-update] and
   [I-D.link-v6ops-gulla].  But there have been other somewhat recent
   instances, such as [slaac-renum-05] (a mechanism in an earlier
   version of the WG document).

   Support of [RFC8028] is key to be able to support multi-router/multi-
   prefix IPv6 networks.  Without it, a simple and common home setup
   scenario where a home network is connected to two different ISPs via
   two CPEs routers simply does not work.

   There's a bit of work that is still needed in this area:

   *  Extrapolate RFC 8028 such that the same principles are applied to
      other SLAAC information (and not just to PIOs/prefixes).

   *  Provide more explicit guidance on how to implement RFC8028 -- in
      particular, spelling out corner cases.

   *  Updating the Node Requirements RFC such that RFC 8028 support is
      required (Note: Rule 5.5 in [I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6724-update] relies
      on the implementation of RFC 8028.  However, while Rule 5.5 is in
      the process of becoming mandatory ("MUST"), the underlying support
      (RFC8028) is not mandatory.

   This document aims at tackling these three items.

2.  Introduction

   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is based on the
   assumption that SLAAC routers will advertise configuration
   information on a local network, and SLAAC hosts will agregate this
   information and use it they see fits.  Simple network scenarios where
   there is a single local router, or where there are multiple routers
   but all routers advertise the same information, or where all
   advertised information is equivalent, SLAAC works just fine.
   However, more complex (yet very common) where a users attaches two
   Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) routers to a local network for
   improved network resilience, may very well fail in a number of ways.

   [RFC8028] was first to analyze the following problematic scenario:

   *  Two SLAAC routers (Router A and Router B) are connected to Network
      C

   *  Router A advertises prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 for address
      configuration, and also enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  Router B advertises prefix 2001:db8:b::/64 for address
      configuration, and also enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  Host C attaches to Network C, and thus configures addresses in
      both prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 and 2001:db8:b::/64.

   Clearly, things will work fine if packets sourced from prefix
   2001:db8:a::/64 employ Router A as the next-hop, while packets
   sourced from prefix 2001:db8:b::/64 employ Router B as the next-hop.
   However, in all other cases packets will be dropped, as a result of
   ingress/egress filtering policies enforced by Router A and Router B.

Internet-Draft  Improving Support for Multi-Router and M    October 2024


   [RFC8028] readily recommends that hosts record whichrouter advertised
   which prefixes, and also hints that e.g.  Route Information Options
   (RIOs) should be associaced with the PIOs advertised by the router
   advertising the PIO itself. e.g., in a scenario whe,re:

   *  Router A advertises prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 for address
      configuration, and advertises a RIO for prefix 2001:db8:10::/64.

   *  Router B advertises prefix 2001:db8:b::/64 for address
      configuration.

   The route to 2001:db8:10::/64 should only be employed for packets
   sourced from prefix 2001:db8:a::/64, and hence, in his case, via
   Router A.

   While [RFC8028] definitely provides correct advice, there are two
   gaps in the specification, that this document is meant to address:

   *  Extrapolating RFC 8028 to other network configuration information.

   *  Considering some corner cases that must be properly handled when
      implementing the recommendations from [RFC8028].

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Improving Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefix Networks

4.1.  Extrapolating RFC 8028 to other network configuration information

   Consider an expanded version of the scenario discussed in Section 2:

   *  Two SLAAC routers (Router A and Router B) are connected to Network
      C

   *  Router A advertises prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 for address
      configuration, advertises the RDNSS 2001:db8:aaaa::1, and also
      enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  RDNSS 2001:db8:aaaa::1 enforces a security policy where DNS
      queries are only allowed from 2001:db8:a::/64.

Internet-Draft  Improving Support for Multi-Router and M    October 2024


   *  Router B advertises prefix 2001:db8:b::/64 for address
      configuration, advertises the RDNSS 2001:db8:bbbb::1 and also
      enforces ingress filtering [RFC2827].

   *  RDNSS 2001:db8:bbbb::1 enforces a security policy where DNS
      queries are only allowed from 2001:db8:b::/64.

   *  Host C attaches to Network C, and thus configures addresses in
      both prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 and 2001:db8:b::/64.

   Even if Host C implements the advice from [RFC8028] and pick a valid
   {Source Address, Next-Hop} pair, it might still end up sending DNS
   queries from a prefix that the RDNSS is not expecting to serve.
   Thus, the general idea is that:

   *  IPv6 prefixes are associated with the SLAAC routers that have
      advertised them.

   *  Any routing information (such as that conveyed via RIOs and
      Redirect messages) are to be employed only for packets with a
      Source Address in the IPv6 Prefix set of the router that
      advertised this information.

   *  Any host-related information (such as RDNSS and RDNSSL) should be
      employed Source Address in the IPv6 Prefix set of the router that
      advertised this information.

4.2.  RFC 8028 corner cases

   Consider the following scenario:

   *  Three SLAAC routers (Router A, Router B, and Router C) are
      connected to Network D.

   *  Router A advertises prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 for address
      configuration.

   *  Router B advertises prefix 2001:db8:b::/64 for address
      configuration.

   *  Router C advertises prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 and 2001:db8:c::/64 for
      address configuration,.

   *  Host D attaches to Network D, and thus configures addresses in
      prefixes 2001:db8:a::/64, 2001:db8:b::/64, and 2001:db8:c::/64.

Internet-Draft  Improving Support for Multi-Router and M    October 2024


   Let us now consider that Router C now advertises 2001:db8:a::/64 with
   a Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime of 0.  While Host D might be
   tempted to simply remove any configured addresses for such prefix, it
   should only disassociate prefix 2001:db8:a::/64 with Router C.
   However, this should not affect the association of prefix
   2001:db8:a::/64 with Router A, or the associated remaning lifetimes
   of that prefix, in association with Router A.

   Only when a piece of SLAAC information is no longer assiated with any
   router should the associated configuration be removed from a system.

5.  Requirements

5.1.  Host Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefix IPv6 Networks

   SLAAC hosts SHOULD record which router (as identified by its IPv6
   link-local address and the associated zone index) advertised each
   piece of SLAAC network configuration information.

   Specifically, SLAAC routers SHOULD associate each SLAAC router with
   an IPv6 prefix set, where the prefix set is composed of all prefixes
   that has been advertised by the router via SLAAC PIOs (irrespective
   of how e.g. the "A" and "L" flags of the PIO were set).

   Routing inforamation conveyed in SLAAC RIOs or Redirect messages
   SHOULD be associated with the prefix set of the router that
   advertised the information, and SHOULD only be employed for IPv6
   packets sourced from addresses in that prefix set.

   Server-type information such as RDNSS SHOULD be associated with the
   prefix set of the router that advertised it.  Hosts SHOULD perform
   queries to such servers from IP addresses belonging to the prefix set
   of the router that advertised the servers.

5.2.  Node Requirements

   This document formally updates [RFC8504] as follows:

      Support for Multi-Router and Multi-Prefix Networks

      Nodes MUST Implement the recommendations specified in [RFC8028]
      and [this document].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document does not introduce any new attack vectors to the ones
   associated with IPv8 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] and IPv6 Stateless
   Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).

   If attacks based on forged RA packets are a concern, technologies
   such as RA-Guard [RFC6105] [RFC7113] should be deployed.
